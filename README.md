# ActivityTracker
A react native app to keep track of my activity hourly

## Why
Strating from 01/09/2023, I will be unemployed and plan to take a brake from the active world. The app will help me manage how I spend my time and not dig myself in depression again.

## How
The app will send a notification every hour to ask what I'm currently doing. I will be able to create/choose activities and specifie them. For example:
- Social activity
  - Indoor
  - Outdoor
- Food related
  - Cooking
  - Groceries
  - Eating
    - Indoor
    - Outdoor

Configuration will allow "periods", a special activity where you have to manually stop the activity from the app or static notification ==> the app won't ask you every hour when you stop the activity (e.g. sleep, work, etc)


## Screens

- Dashboard with today and yesterday activities

Overall view:
